    <h1>Suggester læsekompas documentation</h1>
    <p>This service provides suggestions for content in læsekompasset/MinNæsteBog, through the following API:</p>
    <h2>Suggester part</h2>
    <var>/suggest{/e_book|audio_book}?query={q}</var>
    <p>
        <kbd>{/e_book|audio_book}</kbd> is optional, and specifies whether you filter suggestions to either EBooks or
        Audio Books. If not specified, all types of books are suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
        The query which suggestions are based on, is specified with <kbd>?query</kbd> parameter.
    </p>
    <h2>Searcher part</h2>
    <var>/search?query={q}&field={author|title|workid|pid optional}&exact={optional default: false}&rows={optional, default: 10}</var>
    <p>
        The query which suggestions are based on, is specified with <kbd>?query</kbd> parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <kbd>field</kbd> specifies which field should be searched, options are author, title, workid and pid. If no
        <kbd>field</kbd> is specified, a "full-text search" is assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <kbd>exact</kbd> specifies whether the query should match exactly. This parameter is only in effect when
        <kbd>field</kbd> is specified. This is useful for retrieving a specific title, or documents from a specific
        author.
    </p>
    <p>
        <kbd>merge_workid</kbd> boolean flag indicating if only 1 manifestation pr. work should be returned. Merges on
        workid, selects book, then EBook then audio book. The manifestation of each category (book/ebook/audio book) is
        the most "popular" book, meaning the one with most loans, if there is a tie, the most recently registered.
    </p>
    <p>
        <kbd>rows</kbd> specifies the maximum number of rows returned, defaults to 10.
    </p>
    <p>
        <kbd>branch_id</kbd> optional branch ID, filters so only results matching the query and exist on the given branch
        are returned. As of now, only branches having materials on the bibliographic post that represents the work can
        show up when filtering. This means that libraries having holdings of the same work, but not the exact books
        that are indexed (representing the work) does not show up.
    </p>
    <p>
        <kbd>filter_status</kbd> optional filter_status, filters so that only results matching the given filter status
        are returned.
